# IC-Data

## Project Overview

ic-data is a decentralized data storage and sharing platform deployed on the Internet Computer (IC) blockchain. Developed using the Motoko programming language, this project aims to establish a trusted data ecosystem.

Key Features:
- Ensures data quality and credibility through rigorous data provider verification
- Leverages IC blockchain's distributed storage capabilities for permanent and highly available data storage
- Provides consensus-verified, high-value data access services to all users
- Specifically designed to support on-chain AI applications with reliable data infrastructure

### Purpose
The project serves as a foundation for valuable data consensus, where verified data providers can contribute trusted content that is accessible to all visitors. By utilizing blockchain technology, it ensures data integrity and availability while creating a robust data foundation particularly suited for on-chain AI applications.
